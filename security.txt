ruamel.yaml is being quarantined in my organization which is generating vulnerability reports. This is a long standing issue.

Is there a resolution / workaround? I can't install from internet pypi.

rasa==1.6.0
rasa-sdk==1.6.1
ruamel.yaml==0.15.100

Can we use some other package instead of ruamel.yaml
